# Agenda
* RxJS Higher and lower order operators and real life examples
* What is a higher order observable
* Promise as an observable
* Operators that transform from first order to second order observable
* Operators that “flatten” higher order observables
* Real life example: flattening stock market update streams
* If time permits: Real life example: state machine using operators
